	Examining intermediate results
        -------------------------------

1. From the VHDL simulation log, one can examine
   internal system activity during the simulation.

   In your design, introduce signals to record 
   events.  In the current sample program, this
   is done via the declarations

   $pipe mmul_I : $uint<8> $signal
   $pipe mmul_J : $uint<8> $signal
   $pipe mmul_START: $uint<8> $signal
   $pipe mmul_END: $uint<8> $signal

2.  Write to these signals at important points
    in your program.   For example, in the
    current sample program, 

		mmul_I := I
		mmul_J := J

    are assigned to values which indicate the
    loop iteration indices in the mmul module.

    
3.  Writes to the mmul_* signals will be logged
    in the VHDL simulation.  

    ./ahir_system_test_bench 2>&1 | grep mmul_* | grep WPIPE

    will show you the writes to these signals and
    the time instants at which these writes happened.


4. For more detail, save the waveform etc..
