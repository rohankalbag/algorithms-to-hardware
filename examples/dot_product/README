plain
	The simplest loop for dot-product.

unroll_by_2
	The loop unrolled by 2.

	This gives twice the performance of the
	plain version, and has twice the utilization
	of the plain version.

unroll_by_2_parallel_2_way
	Two parallel engines, each working
	on half the dot-product, with the
	loop unrolled by 2.

	This gives twice the performance of the
	previous version, and has the same utilization
	as the previous version.
